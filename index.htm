		<b>Introduction:</b><br/>The installation of the MDS Collivery plugin is as easy as a few clicks of the mouse, once installed the plugin will only need you to enter your username and password but by default our demo account is used so that you may test your new plugin before going live. <br/> This plugin gives your WooCommerce the ability to get prices from MDS Collivery based on the dimensions and weight of the products added to your client’s cart as well an option to automatically send the delivery to MDS Collivery or have you do so manually in your backend once your client has checked out, also allowing you to modify the particulars of the delivery before sending the delivery request to MD Collivery. <br/> Once the delivery is accepted, the delivery's details are saved in your database where you can access the delivery in order to track its status, display parcel images and proof of delivery. Your clients too have the ability to track the delivery but not to display parcel images or proof of delivery.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Prerequisites before installing Collivery Extension:</b><br/>• WordPress Version: From 3.8.1 To 4.3.1<br/> • WooCommerce Version: From 2.1.5 To 2.4.7<br/>• PHP Version 5.3 or above <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">(Warning do not install the plugin if your PHP version is below 5.3)</span>

	<p>
		<b>Make sure before installing this plugin that you make a full SQL database backup and a full backup of all your files. If for some reason something goes wrong you will need this backup to get your website back to where it was before. Also please note before updating your Wordpress or Woocommerce version make sure you confirm with us that the plugin does support the new version.</b>
	</p>

    <p style="color: red;">
        We have found a bug with the plugin where any weights stored in product variations are not used by the plugin when fetching prices from MDS Collivery. The only way to prevent this issue from affecting pricing is to create a product for each variation you have with its own weight and dimension settings. If you are using variations for other reasons for example different colors then this issue will not affect you.

Once it has been installed click on Activate Plugin. That’s it, the plugin is installed and ready for action.

				<li>
					New free delivery method which can be customized according to your clients shopping cart total and also only allow this free delivery method for local deliveries. MDS determines local deliveries by determining if both the collection and delivery address belong to the same MDS hub group, if you have any questions regarding hub groups you can contact MDS customer services.
				</li>
				<li>Enable or disable the <a href="#automated">automated processing feature</a>.</li>
				<li>Include risk cover, MDS offers risk cover on the contents of your delivery by up to R5000.00</li>

		That’s all the configuring we need to go through, the rest should be self explanatory.</p>

			<h2><a name="client_usage" href="#client_usage">Front End Usage (Client Side)</a></h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			On the clients end there is only one change the plugin has made, this being the default fields in your clients billing and shipping address. These fields are required by the plugin in order to get prices from MDS Collivery. We have added towns, suburbs and location types to the fields.

			<h2><a name="admin_usage" href="#admin_usage">Back End Usage (Admin Side)</a></h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			This section is the last and final part to the MDS Collivery plugin, in this section you the admin will be able to view orders that have not been confirmed as of yet.
		<p>

		<p>
			Our first function is located in your WooCommerce edit order page. In the edit page on the top right under order actions in the drop down list, there is an option called Confirm MDS Shipping.
		</p>
		<img src="images/order_action.jpg"/><br/>

		<p>
			If you select that option and click Save Order you will be taken a page where you can edit details of the order, get prices and accept the delivery which passes the delivery on to MDS Collivery.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here you will be able to change collection address and destination address as well as the delivery service. You can even include some written instructions for the driver and add additional parcels.
		</p>

		<p>
			Which Collection Address: for both collection and destination just gives you the option of adding a new address to your lists of addresses in you MDS Collivery account or pick from the addresses already in that list. We have added some validation just to help make sure that the required information gets passed on to the API.
		</p>

        <p>
            Once you have accepted the delivery the delivery will be sent to MDS Collivery and the order status will be changed to processing and you will be redirected back to the edit order page in WooCommerce.
        </p>

		<p>
			If "automatically send the delivery to MDS Collivery" is enabled in the settings the above is automatically done for you, but you can still use the option Confirm MDS Shipping to view what information was sent to MDS, but you will not be allowed to submit that delivery request again.
		<p>

		<p>
			The delivery is now saved and you can gain access to it by clicking on MDS Confirmed link under the WooCommerce menu item.
		</p>
		<img src="images/mds_confirmed.jpg"/><br/>

		<p>
			Here you can view all past deliveries. If you click on one of the deliveries you then have access to parcel images, proof of deliveries and tracking information for each delivery.

			<h2><a name="automated" href="#automated">Automated system to send delivery requests through to MDS</a></h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			This new feature runs when ever a payment gateway calls the woocommerce payment_complete() function or a payment method of either EFT or Cheque is used and you manually change the status to processing. As soon as this automated process begins, it will check if the order has already been processed and if not we will send the request to MDS. Some things to keep in mind with this feature, the collection address used will always be the default address linked to your MDS account. Also if your client changes any details to their address a new address will be created in MDS system so this automated process might fill up your list of addresses.
